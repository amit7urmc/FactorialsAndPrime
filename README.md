Finding prime number working in a crude sense. Checked upto 101.

- Finding prime number working in a crude sense. 
- Two ways this program can be used.
- (a) By letting know the cut-off length of prime (i.e. cut-off of number of digits in the prime)
- (b) By letting know the cut-off of number of primes generated (i.e how many primes are required to be generated)
- Finally one can opt to print out all the primes or just the highest prime.
